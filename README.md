# WST-795-Research-Project

## Overview
This repository contains files from a research project aimed at analyzing and comparing two newly proposed control charts with existing control charts. The focus of the research is on the design, performance, and robustness of the charts in both in-control (IC) and out-of-control (OOC) scenarios.

### Files Included:

1. **W-NSSGR EWMA.ipynb**  
   This file explores the design and out-of-control performance of the proposed W-NSSGR EWMA control chart.

2. **W-SSGR EWMA.ipynb**  
   This file explores the design and out-of-control performance of the proposed W-SSGR EWMA control chart.

3. **Synthetic W-EWMA.ipynb**  
   This file evaluates the design and out-of-control performance of the existing Synthetic W-EWMA Control Chart.

4. **W-EWMA.ipynb**  
   This file evaluates the design and out-of-control performance of the existing W-EWMA Control Chart.

5. **Comparisons.ipynb**  
   This file compares the proposed charts (W-NSSGR EWMA and W-SSGR EWMA) with the existing charts. It includes an analysis of out-of-control performance and the in-control robustness of the proposed charts.

## Purpose
- **Proposed Charts:** The proposed charts are designed to detect shifts in a process more effectively in various scenarios.
- **Existing Charts:** These are included for comparison to benchmark the performance of the proposed charts.
- **Comparison:** A detailed comparison between the proposed and existing charts is conducted, highlighting the strengths of each chart and how well the proposed charts perform under both in-control and out-of-control conditions.
